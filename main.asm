SECTION "Stadium 2 Checksums", ROMX[$7DE0], BANK[$7F]

; The end of the ROM is taken up by checksums of the content, apparently used
; by Pokémon Stadium 2 due to the checksums' "N64PS3" header. (In Japan,
; Pokémon Stadium Gold and Silver was the third Stadium release for N64.)
; This SECTION reserves space for those checksums.
; If it is removed, also remove the "tools/stadium" command in the Makefile.
